*  Given 2 identical DOM trees (but not equal) and one element of the first DOM tree, how would you find this element in the second DOM tree?  
*  Write an array flatten function.  
*  Write an emitter class:
*  Can you write a function that deeply flattens an array?  
*  Given two identical DOM tree structures, A and B, and a node from A, find the corresponding node in B.  
*  Explain the concept of ES6 Promises to a 5-year-old.  
*  What are the advantages of using ES6 maps over objects? What about using ES6 sets over arrays?  
*  design/code a poll widget

*  Given a grid of characters output a decoded message. The message for the following would be IROCKA. (diagonally down right and diagonally up right if you can't go further .. you continue doing this)
I B C A L K A
D R F C A E A
G H O E L A D

*  you should know event bubbling, debounce (its variant)... know how to code it 
*  Poll Widget question (just know your positioning, relative, static etc know the differences inside out). 
*  If you have 500 revisions of a program, write a program that will find and return the FIRST bad revision given a isBad(revision i) function.  
*  Given an input array and another array that describes a new index for each element, mutate the input array so that each element ends up in their new index. Discuss the runtime of the algorithm and how you can be sure there won't be any infinite loops.  
*  Given a picture, how would you hide/show a child picture on hovering on this parent?  
*  How would you ensure clicking on this picture would go to a specific link?  
*  How would you ensure the child is positioned in the top right of the parent picture?  
*  Given an array, return it's flattened structure(skip objects)  
*  what is 'this', what is closure, var vs const vs let, DOM tree  
*  Basic graph algo & DS style whiteboarding question  
*  Front-end related algorithms and DS questions  
*  Implement a simple store class with set(Node, value), get(Node) and has(Node) methods, which store a given Nodes with corresponding values.  
*  Implement a square root function.
*  how could you implement debouncing?
*  Say you wanted the `handleScroll` function to be called only after 200ms has passed between scroll events
*  Build a puzzle game with Javascript
